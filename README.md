# Machine-Learning-Chronic-Kidney-Disease
# Predicting chronic kidney disease using machine learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has a chronic kidney disease based on their medical attributes.

## Problem Defenition
In a statement
> Given clinical parameters about patients, can we predict whether or not they have a chronic kidney disease? This is a binary classification problem.
## Data
This dataset is originally from UCI Machine Learning Repository. However, this is a cleaned dataset from Kaggle.
